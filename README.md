# Implementation Plan 4/12
## Implementation + Testing
- How you will initialize your particle cloud (`initialize_particle_cloud`)?
- How you will update the position of the particles will be updated based on the movements of the robot (`update_particles_with_motion_model`)?
- How you will compute the importance weights of each particle after receiving the robot's laser scan data?(`update_particle_weights_with_measurement_model`)?
- How you will normalize the particles' importance weights (`normalize_particles`) and resample the particles (`resample_particles`)?
- How you will update the estimated pose of the robot (`update_estimated_robot_pose`)?
- How you will incorporate noise into your particle filter localization?
